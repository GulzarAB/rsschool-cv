### Briefly About Myself:
Having started my career as a layout designer in a local newspaper with minimum skills, I became profficient in printing design.
My keen interest in printing technologies led me to working as a Prepress and DTP Engineer in the largest printing house in my city,
where I continued self-learning, examining the process of creating wine and food labels, magazines and other printed goods.

Three years ago I’ve become passionate about retouching. I’ve mastered different retouching techniques,
learned to work with graphic tablet, become an advanced Photoshop user and found my first job as a retoucher.

### Code example:
**From leetcode.com**Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
```
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;

let twoSum = function(nums,target) {
    let map = new Map;
    for (let i=0; i<nums.length;i++) {
        let complement = target-nums[i];
        if(map.has(complement)) {
            return[map.get(complement),i]
        }
        map.set(nums[i],i);
    }
    
}
console.log(twoSum(nums,target));
